# GitHub Repo Metadata Analytics

This project performs data analysis on GitHub repository metadata using Python and libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **DuckDB**.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand trends and patterns across open-source repositories, including:
- Distribution of stars, forks, and issues
- Popular programming languages
- Relationship between activity indicators (commits, pull requests) and repository popularity

## 🧪 Hypothesis Testing

- **H₀ (Null Hypothesis):** Repository popularity (stars) is independent of activity indicators (commits, forks, pull requests).  
- **H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):** Repository popularity is influenced by these activity indicators.

Statistical tests such as correlation and scatter plots were used to test this relationship.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.11**
- **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **scipy**
- **DuckDB** for querying Parquet data
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
